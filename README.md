# Little Lemon Booking Website

## Project Description
This project originated from Meta's Coursera course on Front-End Development. It represents the culmination of skills learned in the Front-End Development Track.

The website demonstrates the implementation of a booking application for the Little Lemon Website. It utilizes React Components to illustrate proficiency in using React for website development, along with API integration.

It's important to mention that, apart from the design, the only operational feature on the website is the "Reserve a Table" function.
